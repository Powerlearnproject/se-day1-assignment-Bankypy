#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is simply the process of designing, development and maintaining software. The importance of software engineering in technology industry cannot be underemphasised as it is capable of improving software development life cycle. This implies that software engineering helps to improve the timeframe of software development process.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming languages (i.e Pascal, Fotran and other low level languages
2. The advent of software engineering as a profession
3. the emergence of  project management methodologies (i.e Agile, Waterfall etc).
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements Gathering: The process of documenting, collecting important data for the project so it could meets the stated requirments.
2. design: The involves design the project layouts where developers like UI/UX comes in to give a templates for the project.
3. implementation: after the design, implementations comes in play via coding, sprint meetings etc.
4. testing: After the successful phase of the coding phase, tester would need to test for errors, bugs before the project gets to the end-users.
5. deployment: Releasing the software to end-users
6. Maintenance: The process of providing support service to the project deployed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies is not iterative like Agile methodologies. For instance, in Waterfall model, project follow a sequence from start to finish making it difficult to go back to bugs detected at any point in the testing stage. On the other hand Agile methodology gives developers room to correct bugs at any point in the development stages. Agile involves sprint(short meetings), different segment of developers (product owners, business analysis, developers, testers, stakeholders) for the smooth process of the project.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developers: They are in charge of writing codes, providing support based on testers reported bugs.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer: Mostly are testers who ensures that the project is void of bugs, errors and have the required quality to suits end-users needs.
3. Project Managers: overseas the overall aspect of the projects.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide developers with interface to write codes, compile and edit codes. VCS employs a collaborative software that aids the efficiency of software development I.e Github, 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. change of interface or part of the project
   solutions: agile methodology, communicating well with stakeholder, developers
   2. Tight deadlines
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit testing refers to the process of testing a portion/part of the software
2. Integration testing refers to the process of testing the inter-related areas/interative components of the software.
3. system testing refers to the process of testing the whole software as a whole.
4. acceptance testing refers the processing of testing software based on acceptance criteria.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers creating consised, simple sentence to AI to generate accurate result.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt is; Can you describe a black man?
A better prompt: Describe a man from Nigeria with dark skin?
Anyone can be black man but specifying a man from nigerian with dark skin would be more direct.
